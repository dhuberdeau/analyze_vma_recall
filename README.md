# Analysis Code for recall variant of visuomotor association study
David M. Huberdeau

This code analyzes the data obtained for the behavior-only recall-variant visuomotor association study. In this study, human participants are trained in the Timed-Response paradigm, and then given symbol-target associations to memorize. Those symbols appear in the study as cues presented ~3 seconds prior to the appearance of an actual target. On some trials, instead of the symbol, a target itself appears as a cue, and sometimes no cue is provided. All cues are 90% reliable; when a cue is unreliable, a different target (chosen at random from among the remaining targets) is presented instead without the participant's prior awareness. 

The primary objective of this experiment was to validate behavior for a future imaging study, and additional behavioral studies, such as the statistical learning-variant, and a variant that parameterizes the latency between symbol appearance and movement onset.
